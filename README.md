# BaseballMetricPercentiles
This program determines the averages and percentiles (based on mean and standard deviation) of a variety of advanced metrics for all of NCAA 
Division I baseball. The program calculates both player averages (calculating the mean and standard devitation for a variety of metrics from 
qualified players) and pitch averages (not based on player averages). This program will be used in conjunction of others to determine the 
abilities of a given player and compare them to the rest of Division I college baseball.
